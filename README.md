# Northeastern Student Utilities Guide

## Project Overview

The **Northeastern Student Utilities Guide** is a one-page website designed to help new students at Northeastern University find essential stores and services around Boston. This guide includes popular places for groceries, electronics, clothing, and household goods, all conveniently located near the campus. The website is fully responsive, with a modern dark theme, and uses HTML, CSS, and various multimedia elements.

## Website Features

### HTML/HTML5 Elements Used

- **Table**: A table is used to display the list of places (like Target, Best Buy, etc.) along with their categories and locations.
- **Form**: A contact form is included where users can submit their name, email, and message.
- **Images**: Images are used for each individual place section to give visual representation.
- **Hyperlinks**: All place names and the addresses link to their respective Google Maps locations. Additionally, `mailto` and `tel` links are used for contacting.

- **Audio**: Background audio plays on the website, which can be controlled via a popup.

- **Header and Footer**: A header introduces the assignment, and a footer includes copyright information and contact links.
- **Summary**: The "About Me" section includes a collapsible summary that can be expanded for more details.
- **Menu**: The navigation bar uses a dropdown menu for accessing individual sections of the website.

2. **Welcome Section**: The introduction includes animated headings and a video of Northeastern University.
3. **Places Table**: A table with clickable links to different stores, along with categories and addresses.
4. **Individual Place Sections**: Each store (e.g., Target, Best Buy) has its own section with an image, description, and Google Maps link.
5. **About Me Section**: An "About Me" section with a photo and a collapsible summary.
6. **Contact Form**: A simple contact form where visitors can submit their information.
7. **Footer**: Includes copyright information and contact links.

### CSS Styling
An external CSS file is used for styling the entire website. The website follows a dark theme with white text and colored highlights for better readability and visual appeal. Each section is carefully padded and spaced to ensure consistency and a clean design. Animations are applied for scrolling effects, making the user experience more dynamic.
